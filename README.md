# My Financial Picture

This project aims to develop a modern personal finance management platform, providing users with a centralized hub for tracking financial accounts, budgeting and expense categorization. Initially, the new platform will rely on user inputs tied to a secure database that will offer synchronization of bank accounts, investments, cryptocurrency, and any financial data that users decide to add. Unlike its predecessor, which has been discontinued, this project seeks to improve upon Mint.comâ€™s original features by incorporating AI-driven insights. 

The platform will be designed for **web** use, ensuring accessibility and convenience for users seeking a comprehensive financial dashboard. Documentation provided outlines the proposed scope, architecture, and roadmap for developing this project as a senior capstone project that covers the breadth of computer science.
